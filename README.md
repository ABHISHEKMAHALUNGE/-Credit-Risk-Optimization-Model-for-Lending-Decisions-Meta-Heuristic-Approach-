## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to develop optimal heuristic algorithms and integrate meta-heuristic approaches, particularly evolutionary algorithms, to identify eligible customers for loan approval. By leveraging these advanced techniques, the model aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of credit risk assessment.

## Features

- Implementation of various heuristic algorithms for credit risk assessment.
- Integration of evolutionary algorithms and other meta-heuristic approaches.
- Experimental amalgamation and hybridization of distinctive algorithms to anticipate early convergence.
- Performance evaluation metrics and visualization tools.
